# Arogya - Decentralized Medical Records Storage + Data DAO

Users can store their Medical Records with user Ownership.
By Default the files are private if users want they can make it as public.

In case of Emergency (like accident, where user maybe unconscious), the user will have his/her own unique ID, Which allows medical personals to see his/her Age, Name, Blood Group, Allergies, Medications and other public documents.

We allow users to monetize their data by setting a price of their medical records.
This allows users to receive compensation for sharing their data. Additionally, ensuring that they have complete control over their data.
